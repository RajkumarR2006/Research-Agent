# 🤖 Research Agent – AI-Powered Academic Research Assistant

An AI system designed to support academic and industrial researchers by automating literature search, summarization, citation analysis, and trend identification. Built using IBM Watsonx.ai, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and the IBM Granite Model, this agent reduces research time, improves quality, and enhances collaboration.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Researchers, students, and professionals struggle to keep up with the rapidly increasing volume of academic publications and evolving trends. Manual literature reviews, citation tracking, and reference management are time-consuming and inefficient.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

A smart Research Agent that leverages NLP and RAG to:
- Autonomously search for academic literature
- Summarize papers with keyword extraction
- Organize references and citations
- Identify research gaps and suggest collaborators
- Draft sections of scientific reports

## 🚀 How It Works

1. User enters a research question (e.g., "LLMs in Education")  
2. Watsonx + Granite model interpret the query  
3. Vector Index fetches relevant documents  
4. The agent summarizes content and suggests references  
5. Provides report draft or research guidance

## 📌 How to Run or Deploy

1. Log in to [IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com)  
2. Launch Watsonx AI Studio  
3. Create an AI Agent project  
4. Upload academic papers to a Vector Index  
5. Configure agent instructions and intent limitations  
6. Use the Preview tab to test queries  
7. Deploy using Web App, Streamlit, or API
